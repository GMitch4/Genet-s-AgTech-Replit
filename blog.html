 <h2>Agriculture</h2>
  <p> Even though I have only complete one full week of this program, I feel like I have found my true passion! Food is my passion and I am finally gaining the confidence to see where I can make an affordable living engaging with food. From soil to table is where I see myself when it comes to agriculture. Literally being able to host community potlucks or just enjoying time with my family while looking at my plate and being proud I was able to grow the food I am about to eat. Sustainably!</p>
 
  <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p> I don't consider myself the most tech-savvy person but I am always willing to give anything a try to pick up a skill! Coding my own website takes me back to my copy and paste moments on Myspace. I just feel like I can call myself more of an intermediate copy and paster now. On our tech days as I realize it is not as hard as it comes across. It is really about setting yourself up for success through organization. </p>
  
  <h2>Construction</h2>
    <p> By the end of this program I know I will definitely have amazing upper body strength. The construction class was amazing on Sunday. Having a father who is an all-around handy man made learning tools easier. I usually just know the basic names of each tools but now I can tell you the difference between two types of saws and drills. You never know I might come out with my own type of cushion tools for left-handed people.</p>
  
  <h2>Hands-On</h2>
    <p> What I value the most from this program is the hands-on experience. Having the ability during class to really talk about our systems and get feedback is tremendously helpful. Coding along with our instructor really helps to build my tech confidence. (Especially when I can keep up with the fast typing.) Having guest speakers also helping us along our journey really makes this program unique. Lastly, to physically build our construction skills and see the fruits of our labor from that project alone is rewarding. Moments like these create life-time experiences.</p>
